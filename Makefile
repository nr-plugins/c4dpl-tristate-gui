# Template makefile for compiling Cinema 4D plugins from the command-line
# using the [Cinema 4D makefile collection][1] by Niklas Rosenstein. This
# makefile can be copied into a plugins' directory and modified to fit
# your needs.
#
# Targets:
# - plugin: Builds the plugin
# - clear: Removes all built object-files
#
# For rebuilding the plugin completely, use `make clear plugin`.
